This is the raw content of my blog [www.mseri.me],
it may contain yet unpulished drafts.

I used to serve a ghost instance on my VPN but due to some problems with
the provider and poor server performances (not due to Ghost, it was
actually pretty lightweight and stable) I've decided to move the blog to
some other platform.

I will not go into details but I've decided to use a static site
generator, Pelican, and Markdown.
The posts have been generated using a simple python script (present on
one of my gists) that elaborates Ghost's json exported data.
