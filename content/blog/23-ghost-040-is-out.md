Updates for [purity](https://gumroad.com/l/purity) to support all the new features are going to be released very soon.

As you can read from [the official announcement](http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-4/), the new release of Ghost comes with a huge amount of features and updates:

- **Static pages**. You can now toggle any post to be a "page" from within your post settings menu. This will remove it from your post feed. About / Contact / Terms galore!
- **Unsaved changes notifications**. We'll now give you a heads up when you're about to lose unsaved changes. So you can, you know, save.
- **Featured posts**. You can now mark posts as featured, and style them accordingly from within your theme.
- **Sexy new loading bar**. Always know when Ghost is doing something, a little blue bar crawls across the screen to let you know!
- **Quick edit post urls**. You can now slap /edit/ on the end of any post URL and, boom, you're editing it.
- **Date based permalink support**. If you like that kind of thing.
- **SSL support and a more secure password reset process**.
- Over 100 bugfixes and minor improvements!
- [Much, much more](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Release-Notes:-0.4.0)
