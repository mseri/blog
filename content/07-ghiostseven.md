Here we go. On [github](https://github.com/mseri/ghiosSeven) is finally available a new responsive ghost theme inspired by iOS7 look.

It is still a very preliminary version, a cleaning of the stylesheet and some additional tweaks are in progress.

In the next few days I will add a style for forms elements to look like they do in iOS7 and the social/rss icons on the boottom bar, aligned right.

In the meanwhile you can play with it (and may be pull some update for merging) going to [github.com/mseri/ghiosSeven](https://github.com/mseri/ghiosSeven).

~~There is an annoying bug that I was not able to fix up to now: the ordered lists `<ol>` appear unnumbered. Every fix I've tried seemed not to work. If you have an idea, just let me know please.~~ 
Thanks to [David](http://theonlycog.com) this is now fixed.
