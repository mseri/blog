> There is a different way forward. Artificial intelligence doesn’t have to be what it is today. We don’t need to accept the logic of unprecedented scale and consumption to achieve advancement and progress. So much of what our society actually needs—better health care and education, clean air and clean water, a faster transition away from fossil fuels—can be assisted and advanced with, and sometimes even necessitates, significantly smaller AI models and a diversity of other approaches. AI alone won’t be enough, either: We’ll also need more social cohesion and global cooperation, some of the very things being challenged by the existing vision of AI development.
> But the empires of AI won't give up their power easily. The rest of us will need to wrest back control of this technology's future. And we're at a pivotal moment when that's still possi-ble. Just as empires of old eventually fell to more inclusive forms of governance, we, too, can shape the future of AI together.
