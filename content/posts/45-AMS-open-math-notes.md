I have just released a small update to the [Hamiltonian Mechanics lecture notes]({{< relref "44-hamiltonian-mechanics.md" >}} "Hamiltonian Mechanics") [here](https://github.com/mseri/hammech20/releases/download/v1.1/hm.pdf "Lecture Notes v1.1 PDF").
This contains some edits to improve the english and fix a few typos.
The lecture notes have also been approved to appear in the [AMS Open Math Notes](https://www.ams.org/open-math-notes/omn-view-listing?listingId=110861), which seems to be a very nice initiative, full of very interesting and high quality content.
