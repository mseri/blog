The other day I found an old file with links to interesting videos.
Some of them were no longer available, some I still have to check, but [one caught my attention](https://vimeo.com/120725835) and the other evening I decided to watch it.

It is a little documentary on the last conference of [Donald Coexeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter), and I enjoed watching it very much. You can find it embedded below, and linked above. And while collecting links for this post I have also discovered [a nice writeup](https://web.archive.org/web/20220102093914/https://www.math.toronto.edu/mpugh/Coxeter.pdf).
