The upcoming block I have to coordinate a course on giving good talks.
This also meant looking for good extra material for the students to reflect on what it means to give a good talk, what to be aware of and what tips can help to do a good job.
Here is a collection of the resources I liked so far:

- MAA has a [curated list of resources on giving mathematics talks](https://mathcomm.org/teaching-presentations/handouts-other-presentation-resources-for-students/) which includes plenty of [examples of good mathematics presentations](https://mathcomm.org/teaching-presentations/examples-of-good-math-presentations/)
- There is an essay by John McCarthy on [how to give a good colloquium talk](http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/workshops/gcoll.pdf) with a response blog post on [how to give a good 20min talk](https://blog.richmond.edu/wross/2008/03/26/how-to-give-a-good-20-minute-math-talk/)
- On the blog of the AMS there is a nice post on [preparing a conference presentation](https://blogs.ams.org/mathmentoringnetwork/2014/08/04/math-talk-preparing-your-conference-presentation/), from what it means to many resources on how it can be done
- What characterizes a good presentation? There is a nice summary from an [analogous course at MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-821-project-laboratory-in-mathematics-spring-2013/resources/mit18_821s13_presentnotes/)
- Terence Tao has a famous blog post on [giving talks](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/talks-are-not-the-same-as-papers/)
- Jordan Ellenberg has a post with [tips on giving talks](https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/what-to-do-in-talks/) that links an [interesting pdf on the same topic](https://quomodocumque.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/talktipsheet.pdf)
- A nice [essay on giving talks](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~kra/papers/talks.pdf) by Bryna Kra

Let me know on twitter or mastodon (links on the left bar) if you have other suggestions!
