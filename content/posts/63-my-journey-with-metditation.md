Have you ever felt like you are constantly running behind, never quite in control? If so, you are not alone. For a long time, I felt this way too, and sometimes I still do. But over the past couple of years, I have experienced a significant shift in my mindset and overall well-being, and it has been on my mind for a while to share my experience.

If you know me or you have listened to me speak on podcasts, [especially the first times](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S1-Ep7---Failing-Forward-e2oidaa/a-abhk913), you would have found the beginning of this post no surprise. I often felt like I was running behind my agenda, never in control, to the point that this was draining my energies. This feeling has become less and less of a theme in my life, and a few people have asked me why. I can see now that in many respects I have changed. And perhaps it can be useful for someone else if I share what happened to bring about this change.

That's what this post is about. You might know some of this story because it partly came up six months ago in an [episode of Degrees of Freedom](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S4E02---Emotional-health-and-mindfulness-in-education-e2rvs3o), but at that time I was not yet ready to look back and tell the whole thing.

About two years ago, motivated by the feelings I have already described and by the meditation experiences shared by [Oliver](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E05---Pure-Maths--with-Oliver-Lorscheid-and-Jaap-Top-e2g4ibd/a-ab084qc) and [Cecilia](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E03---Teaching-mathematics--with-Tams-Grbe-and-Ceclia-Salgado-e2bsae3/a-aajrsif) in [It is Not Just Numbers](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers),
I decided I had enough and wanted to try something. Meditation had been on my mind for a while. I was aware of the many proven benefits (improved focus and overall well-being, reduced anxiety), I had heard about some of the risks, and I had tried it a few times in the past. It had never really stuck with me.

Months prior, I had already taken a different path: quitting most of my social media accounts and reducing my screen time and phone usage. But that still wasn't enough. I needed something more substantial and introspective. I really felt that I needed to somehow push the brakes and take a breath.

In an interview with Mingyur Rinpoche, a world-renowned meditation teacher, I heard a surprising fact, apparently supported by scientific evidence: _it does not matter how much or how long you meditate, as long as you do it regularly enough_. Since I knew it would be hard to fit anything of reasonable length into my schedule, I decided to embrace this idea and aimed to meditate every day for at least one minute. That is how it started: _one minute a day, with the freedom to make it longer if I wanted_.

The spark that lit the fire was a Black Friday discount on the Headspace app (which I would actually not recommend to anyone). I liked the style of Andy Puddicombe, the founder of Headspace who had long since departed from the company (which I didn't know at that point). So, I thought, why not? I just needed an excuse to start and force myself into it. Paying for something seemed like the right way to guilt myself into starting.

For the first few months, I used the basic and pro courses by Andy on the Headspace app, setting the time to just a couple of minutes so it would be easy to fit into my overflowing schedule. But more than this story itself, what's interesting is the experience. For the first few months, the only thing I noticed was rather clich√©: the more days passed, the worse I felt at being able to focus. *I was constantly lost in thought*. But I had decided to stick with it for as long as I could, and everyone writes that this is a normal phenomenon: I was just becoming more aware of thoughts that would normally have been there anyway. I didn't notice any other difference. For all I knew, I was just wasting my time.

A few months in, I was still lost in thought, but it was becoming more effortless. At least I could feel some temporary relaxation while meditating, which was pleasant. I had also started slowly increasing the time I spent, reaching about 10 to 15 minutes a day in the morning before starting work, with peaks of 20 to 30 minutes when I could afford it. I would enter my office, close the door, and take whatever time I had before 9:00 to sit with my breath. I still didn't notice any other difference though.

Then, in spring, my wife surprised me. Out of nowhere, she told me to stick with whatever I was doing because somehow it had changed how I was relating to her and our kids for the better. This was the first strong validation for me. I honestly hadn't consciously decided to do anything differently, and I didn't even realize that I was doing something differently. But apparently, I was. This was the biggest encouragement to keep going that I could possibly get.

It was only a few more months in, eight or nine months from when I started, that I began to notice some the first small changes. First, when I started meditating, I had issues falling asleep. It would take a substantial while from the time I went to bed to actually falling asleep. I had tried reducing screen time before bed without much success. Then, one morning, I suddenly realized that it had been a while since I had trouble with this. Moreover, on those rare nights when I did struggle, focusing on my breath would help me fall asleep in next to no time.

Another thing I noticed was that I was becoming more aware of my feelings before they fully developed and took over. I would start to feel emotions like anger or sadness coming on, noticing what was triggering them. I still had (and have) the emotional intelligence of a goldfish, but I was noticing these feelings a lot more. I wasn't yet able to take action on this awareness, but the awareness itself was a big change. Alongside this, I could see that I was also starting to be generally more present.

A few more months passed before I noticed that my baseline state had changed. I used to be much more anxious, but now I was calmer and less attached to my triggers.

To this day, I think this is the biggest change I have noticed: being intentionally present and feeling satisfied with my life, even in the face of challenges. I am often amazed by the beauty in small things, like the way light filters through tree leaves or the sound of birds chirping on my way to work. I often surprise myself appreciating these moments without feeling the need to constantly be doing something or achieving a goal. This has brought a sense of peace and contentment that I had not experienced before, or at least not for a long while.

Let's be clear. This doesn't mean I don't get upset, anxious, or sad. In fact, I probably feel those emotions more since I am much more aware of them. And I am still not always able to act on this awareness, especially when I am tired, but the shift is there and it is significant. It means I can now often catch myself before I spiral into negative thought patterns or get overwhelmed by stress. It is not just that it has become easier to act against some of the automatisms I have carried for so long, it has also become easier to connect with others and be present with them.

Some behaviors I have started observing, I have embodied for so long that I do not expect them to change quickly, if at all. But already noticing the difference in some of them after just two years of very minimal practice is quite significant for me. And it is one of the main reasons I am sharing this.

There's another side to this: I now find it much easier to work, organize, and basically stay on top of things instead of being driven around by them. I'm generally more relaxed and energetic, and I can focus for longer periods, even in the midst of overflowing todo lists and packed schedules. I still have a long way to go, but the difference has already been quite significant.

Is all of this the result of meditation? I don't and can't know for certain. It is surely a mix of things, but I would say it reflects pretty much what research has been showing about meditation. I feel more in control of my life and emotions, and I am able to handle stress and challenges a lot better. Well worth the effort (which, really, was mostly minimal).

My most recent observation is that I can now **sometimes** stay with difficult emotions without being overwhelmed by them. Instead of letting emotions control me, I can accept them and use the energy they provide to take action and make positive changes in my life. This is still too new for me to say more. I will need time to understand and develop this skill, and it still feels quite strange. But it is another welcome surprise of this journey, and I am starting to look forward to seeing what comes next.

Overall, if you are feeling stuck in a similar mental situation, I would really recommend giving meditation a try. See for yourself if it works for you. Sometimes the most profound changes come from simply being present and appreciating the beauty around us. We have discussed resilience and emotional intelligence on [Degrees of Freedom](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S4E02---Emotional-health-and-mindfulness-in-education-e2rvs3o) before, an episode motivated by this very journey, and I am curious about your thoughts and experiences. Please share your stories in the comments below.

For those wondering how to start, there are some excellent free applications out there, as well as courses and communities where you can practice, learn, share, and compare ideas. I will link to two that I particularly like: [Medito](https://medito.app/) and [Healthy Minds](https://hminnovations.org/meditation-app). Both are free, run by nonprofit foundations, and the latter is also conducting scientific research on the topic. If you need something more structured, there is the [Joy of Living](https://joy.tergar.org) community that has some of the best courses out there (in my opinion), plus many free resources on their YouTube channel. There are also plenty of free and paid courses on mindfulness-based stress reduction that can be good entry points, but the ones linked above have been very helpful for me. And remember: _short and regular is better than long and irregular_, at least it was for me.
