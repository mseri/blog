Have you ever felt like you are constantly running behind, never quite in control? If so, you are not alone. For a long time, I felt this way too, and sometimes I still do. But over the past couple of years, I have experienced a significant shift in my mindset and overall well-being. I hope that sharing this journey might resonate with others who have felt the same way. It has been helpful for me to read about others' struggles and small victories, so I hope this might do the same for someone else.

If you know me or you have listened to me on podcasts, [especially in the early episodes of Degrees of Freedom](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S1-Ep7---Failing-Forward-e2oidaa/a-abhk913), you won't be surprised by this opening.
I have spoken openly about feeling overwhelmed, as if I were always chasing my own agenda without ever catching up, never feeling in control. That sense of being perpetually behind has mostly faded, and this is not due to changes in my work environment. The truth is, as I am coming to realize it, that I have changed in interesting ways. Note that I am not sharing this because I have "figured it all out", far from it! But I have noticed that even small shifts can ripple outward, in how we parent, work, or show up for others.

That's what this post is about. This isn't the first time I've hinted at this transformation. Some months ago, in another [episode of Degrees of Freedom](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S4E02---Emotional-health-and-mindfulness-in-education-e2rvs3o), I touched on some of these changes, but at the time I wasn't ready to look back. I am still figuring it out, but at least some pieces are clearer.

About two years ago, I decided to try starting a meditation practice. The decision came after months of feeling drained, combined with the inspiration I had drawn from conversations with [Oliver](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E05---Pure-Maths--with-Oliver-Lorscheid-and-Jaap-Top-e2g4ibd/a-ab084qc) and [Cecilia](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E03---Teaching-mathematics--with-Tams-Grbe-and-Ceclia-Salgado-e2bsae3/a-aajrsif) in [It is Not Just Numbers](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers). Meditation had been on my mind for a while, I knew about its benefits (better focus, reduced anxiety, improved well-being) and some of the risks, and had even tried it a few times in the past. But it had never stuck with me.

Before that, I had taken a different approach: quitting most of my social media accounts and reducing my screen time. That helped, but it wasn't enough. I needed something deeper, something that would force me to pause and breathe. Then, in an interview with Mingyur Rinpoche, I heard a surprising piece of advice, seemingly backed by science: _it does not matter how much or how long you meditate, as long as you do it regularly enough_. Since fitting even a short session into my schedule felt impossible, I decided to start with just one minute a day. No more, no less. That was how it began.

The push I needed came from a Black Friday discount on the Headspace app (which, for the record, I wouldn't recommend). I liked Andy Puddicombe's style, even though I didn't realize at the time that he had long since left the company. The discount gave me the excuse I needed to commit. Paying for something made it harder to back out.

For the first few months, I stuck to Headspace's basic and pro courses, keeping sessions short, just a few minutes, to fit them into my packed schedule. The experience itself felt cliché and was underwhelming at first. The more I meditated, the more I noticed how scattered my mind was and how difficult it was to stay present. _I was constantly lost in thoughts_. But I had decided to stick with it for as long as I could, and I had read that this was normal: just becoming aware of thoughts that had always been there. Still, I didn't see any other changes. For all I knew, I was wasting my time.

A few months in, something shifted. I still struggled to focus, but the effort felt lighter. I began to notice temporary relaxation while following the breath or listening to sounds around me, which was pleasant. I also started increasing the time slightly, reaching 10 to 15 minutes in the morning before work, with occasional peaks of 20 to 30 minutes when I had the time. I tend to be there very early, so I would close my office door, sit with my breath, and wait for 9:00 to roll around. But beyond that, nothing else felt different.

Then, in spring, my wife surprised me. Out of nowhere, she said to stick with whatever I was doing because somehow it was positively changing how I was relating to her and our kids. This was the first real validation I had. I hadn't consciously decided to act differently, and I hadn't even noticed the change myself. But somehow, it was happening. That was the biggest encouragement I could possibly get and it kept me going.

It took another eight or nine months before I noticed the first real shifts. One morning, I realized I had not struggled to fall asleep in weeks. At that time, I would lie in bed for what felt like hours, my mind racing, before falling asleep. Now, even on the rare nights when sleep did not come easily, focusing on my breath would lull me under almost instantly.

Another change was subtler but just as significant: I began noticing emotions _before_ they fully took hold. I would catch the early stirrings of anger or sadness, sometimes even recognize what triggered them. Just being aware of them was a huge shift, though I still can't always act on this awareness. Alongside this, I could see that I was becoming more present in everyday moments.

A few months later, I realized my baseline state had changed. I used to be anxious, reactive, and easily triggered. Now, I was calmer, less attached to my usual stressors. The biggest change, though, was that I could be intentionally present and feel satisfied with life, even when challenges arose. I would find myself pausing to appreciate small things, like the way light filtered through leaves, the sound of birds on my walk to work. I no longer felt the need to constantly _do_ something or achieve a goal. That shift brought a peace that I had not experienced before, or at least not for a long while.

Let's be clear: this doesn't mean I no longer get upset, anxious, or sad. If anything, I feel those emotions more intensely now that I am more aware of them. And I am still often unable to act on that awareness, especially when I am tired. But the difference is real and significant. I can often catch myself before spiraling into negative thoughts or getting overwhelmed by stress. It is not just easier to resist some old habits, it got easier to connect with others and be fully present with them.

Some behaviors are so ingrained that I don't expect them to change quickly, if at all, without substantial additional work on my part. But noticing even small shifts after just two years of minimal practice has been very significant for me. That's one of the reasons I am sharing this.

There is also another side to this: I now find it easier to work, organize, and stay on top of things instead of feeling pulled in every direction. Even in very intense working blocks like the current one, where I jokingly tell people that "_I am surviving_", I am generally more relaxed and energetic, able to focus for longer even with a packed schedule and a wild to-do list. I still have a long way to go, but the difference has been noticeable.

Is all of this because of meditation? I don't know for sure. It is likely a mix of factors, but the changes align with what research says about mindfulness. I feel more in control of my life and emotions, better equipped to handle stress. It took time to notice, but the effort has been minimal and the payoff quite unexpected.

My most recent observation is that I can now _sometimes_ sit with difficult emotions without being overwhelmed. Instead of letting them control me, I can acknowledge them and use their energy to take action. It is still new, still strange, but it is another unexpected benefit of this journey. And at this point I am quite curious to see where it leads.

If you are feeling stuck in a similar way, constantly behind, reactive, or overwhelmed, I would encourage you to try meditation. See for yourself if it works for you. Sometimes, the most profound changes come from simply being present and appreciating what is around us. We have discussed resilience and emotional intelligence on [Degrees of Freedom](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S4E02---Emotional-health-and-mindfulness-in-education-e2rvs3o) before, an episode motivated by this very journey, and I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Feel free to share your stories in the comments here or on the podcast page.

For those wondering how to start, there are excellent free resources out there. Two I particularly like are [Medito](https://medito.app/) and [Healthy Minds](https://hminnovations.org/meditation-app), both are free and run by nonprofit foundations, and the latter is also conducting scientific research on the topic. If you want something more structured, the [Joy of Living](https://joy.tergar.org) community has one of the best courses out there (in my opinion), along with many free resources on their YouTube channel. Just remember: _short and regular is better than long and irregular_. At least, that is what worked for me.
