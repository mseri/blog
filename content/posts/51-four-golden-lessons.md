The recent death of [Steven Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg), winner of the Nobel prize in Physics and one of the most brilliant scientists of our times, made many people look back to his incredible production.
In addition to [some incredible eulogies](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5566), this has allowed a lot of little gems to resurface. Here I want to share one of them.

In 2003, Weinberg wrote a short note to PhD students in physics: ["Four Golden Lessons"](https://web.archive.org/web/20201123022309/http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/files/nature.pdf "Steven Weinberg - Four Golden Lessons").

The points he makes are all valid also for mathematicians, and likely for many other disciplines.
The message resonates a lot with what I wanted to convey in the post [On doing a PhD]({{< relref "47-on-doing-a-phd.md">}}), and does a magnificent job in explaining it  better and in a lighter and brighter way.
I hope his lessons can be of help and inspiration to you as well.
