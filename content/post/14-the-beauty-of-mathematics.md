After having watched this video I hope you will agree with [Bertrand Russell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell):

> &quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty &mdash; a beauty cold and austere, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music.&quot;
>
> &mdash; Bertrand Russell

And this is just a scratch of the surface of the mysterious wonderful world that is hiding behind those fascinating symbols.
