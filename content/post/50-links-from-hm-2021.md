Additional material (also linked in the lecture notes):

    As reference for hamiltonian mechanics you can use Knauf, A. (2018) Mathematical Physics: Classical Mechanics. Springer [freely accessible/downloadable from RUG via SpringerLink: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-662-55774-7]
    Two other famous and very good books on classical mechanics are Arnold, V.I. (1989) Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics, Second Edition, Springer, and Marsden, A, Ratiu, T (1998) Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry,  Second Edition, Springer. Another good book is Fasano, Marmi (2006) Analytical mechanics, Oxford University Press, directly accessible from one of the authors' website.
    For a review of differential geometry, you can refer to Lee, J.M. (2012) Introduction to smooth manifolds [freely accessible/downloadable from RUG via SpringerLink: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-9982-5] or to my Analysis on Manifolds lecture notes [https://github.com/mseri/AoM/releases]. A concise summary can be found in: Knauf Appendix A and B, Cannas da Silva (see bullet below) appendices A and B, Marsden-Ratiu Chapter 4, or in the extra material attached in the section below.
    A wonderful text on symplectic geometry is Cannas da Silva, A. (2006) Lectures on Symplectic Geometry [https://people.math.ethz.ch/~acannas/Papers/lsg.pdf]
    Two interesting resources on the KAM theorem are Poschel's article https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2234 and Broer's one http://www.math.rug.nl/~broer/pdf/Ultimate.pdf



Some courses that touch on similar concepts, often from different point of views:

    Video course: Lectures on the Geometry of Theoretical Physics by Schiller
    Video course: Modern Physics: Classical Mechanics by Susskind  (part of his big program: The Theoretical Minimum)
    Book (open access): Sussman and Wisdom, Structure and interpretation of classical mechanics (its objective is to make everything explicitly computable at each point which means it can treat a different part of the material but from a unique perspective, very fun and informative!)
    Article: Demistifying gauge symmetries (physics oriented)
    Slides and notes: Hidden symmetries of the hydrogen atom
    Simulations: https://github.com/mseri/teachingplayground
    Bicycle track problem: On bicycle tire tracks geometry, hatchet planimeter, Menzin's conjecture and oscillation of unicycle tracks and Tire tracks and integrable curve evolution
    Lecture notes: Introduction to integrabilty (and problems)
    Lecture notes: Perturbation theory in cestial mechanics
    Simulation: Rolling disk (and other rolling rigid bodies) -- not really useful to solve the exercise but nice to watch :D
    Paper: The rotor and the pendulum on the general link between rigid body motion and the pendulum
    Lecture notes: Introduction to Mechanics by Marsden
    Video lecture on differential forms (part of a very nice course on discrete differential geometry): https://youtu.be/4zicWglBfIE
    Paper Spherical Pendulum, Action and Spin and Hamiltonian Monodromy and Morse Theory
    Video lectures on asymptotics and perturbation methods by Strogatz
    Very informative video: Steven Strogatz: ask me anything

Meeting (virtually) with your peers

To meet with your peers you can use, for example, the free and open solutions https://meet.jit.si/ and https://jami.net/

For mathematics, it is enormously useful to be able to share computations and drawings. To this end you may use your webcams, mobile phones as webcams (there are plenty of good free apps for that), tablets with collaborative whiteboards, ...

For what concerns collaborative whiteboards I have tried the following, and they all seem to work fine (each has its pros and cons, so I list them all): microsoft whiteboard (https://whiteboard.microsoft.com), google (https://jamboard.google.com), ziteboard (https://ziteboard.com/), whiteboard (https://witeboard.com/).

For editing mathematics online collaboratively I usually use latex and the overleaf online editor: https://www.overleaf.com/

I don't know if it is collaborative, but I have many colleagues that praised https://www.mathcha.io/
