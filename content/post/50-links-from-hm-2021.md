During the current incarnation of the [course in Hamiltonian Mechanics]({{< relref "44-hamiltonian-mechanics.md" >}} "Hamiltonian Mechanics") I have collected some amount of material to share with the students.
To avoid losing it in the guts of our teaching CMS, I leave it here for posterity, practically copy-pasting it without edits because I am really tired :D

The books on SpringerLinks linked below are accessible from our students for free via the university proxy but in general (unfortunately) not open access.

## Additional material (also linked in the lecture notes):

- As reference for hamiltonian mechanics you can use [_Knauf, A. (2018) Mathematical Physics: Classical Mechanics_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-662-55774-7)

- Two other famous and very good books on classical mechanics are _Arnold, V.I. (1989) Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics_, Second Edition, Springer, and _Marsden, A, Ratiu, T (1998) Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry, Second Edition_, Springer. Finally, [F. Zadra](https://sites.google.com/view/fzadra/) recommended me [_Fasano, Marmi (2006) Analytical mechanics_](https://web.archive.org/web/20180417155852/http://homepage.sns.it/marmi/papers/Fasano,%20A.%20&%20Marmi,%20S.%20-%20Analytical%20mechanics%20(Oxford,%202006).pdf), Oxford University Press, directly accessible from one of the authors' website, which also seems very nice.

- For a review of differential geometry, you can refer to [_Lee, J.M. (2012) Introduction to smooth manifolds_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-9982-5) or to my [Analysis on Manifolds lecture notes](https://github.com/mseri/AoM/releases). A concise summary can be also found in:
    - Knauf, appendices A and B
    - Cannas da Silva (see bullet below) appendices A and B,
    - Marsden-Ratiu, Chapter 4,
    - and in the extra material elencated in the next section below.

- A wonderful text on symplectic geometry is [_Cannas da Silva, A. (2006) Lectures on Symplectic Geometry_](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~acannas/Papers/lsg.pdf).

- Finally, two interesting resources on the KAM theorem are [Poschel's article](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2234) and [Broer's one](https://web.archive.org/web/20090625190403/http://www.math.rug.nl/~broer/pdf/Ultimate.pdf).

## Extra material on similar topics

Some courses that touch on similar concepts, often from different point of views:

- Video course: [Lectures on the Geometry of Theoretical Physics](https://www.fau.tv/course/id/242) by Schiller
- Video course: [Modern Physics: Classical Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyX8kQ-JzHI) by Susskind  (part of his big program: The Theoretical Minimum)
- Book (open access): [Sussman and Wisdom, Structure and interpretation of classical mechanics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html). Its objective is to make everything explicitly computable at each point which means it can treat a different part of the material but from a unique perspective, very fun and informative!
- Article: [Demistifying gauge symmetries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10420.pdf) (physics oriented)
- Slides and notes: [Hidden symmetries of the hydrogen atom](https://math.ucr.edu/home//baez/hydrogen/4d/).

## Meeting (virtually) with your peers

To meet with your peers you can use, for example, the free and open solutions [Jitsi meet](https://meet.jit.si/) and [Jami](https://jami.net/). For small groups you could also setup a [Gather Town](https://gather.town) or a [Wonder](https://www.wonder.me/) room.

For mathematics, it is enormously useful to be able to share computations and drawings.
To this end you may use your webcams, mobile phones as webcams (there are plenty of good free apps for that), tablets with collaborative whiteboards, ...

If you want to do fancy stuff with change of scenes and interactive polls, like the one done by [3blue1brown](https://itempool.com/) with [itempool](https://itempool.com/), you can spend some time playing with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

For what concerns collaborative whiteboards I have tried the following, and they all seem to work fine (each has its pros and cons, so I list them all): [microsoft whiteboard](https://whiteboard.microsoft.com), [google](https://jamboard.google.com), [ziteboard](https://ziteboard.com/), [whiteboard](https://witeboard.com/) and [Explain Everything](https://explaineverything.com/).

For editing mathematics online collaboratively I usually use latex and the [overleaf online editor](https://www.overleaf.com/) or [HackMD](https://hackmd.io). I don't know if it is collaborative, but I have many colleagues that praised [Mathcha](https://www.mathcha.io/).
