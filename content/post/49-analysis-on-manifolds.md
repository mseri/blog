In the previous academic term I had the pleasure to teach [Analysis on Manifolds](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/rug/vak/show?code=WBMA013-05), essentially an introduction to differential geometry for third year students.

In the course I tried to address the topic with the perspective that some of the students would be joining also my master [course in Hamiltonian Mechanics]({{< relref "44-hamiltonian-mechanics.md" >}} "Hamiltonian Mechanics") later on next year.
So many of the topics go in the direction of introducing the prerequisites for studying flows, symplectic geometry and sub-Riemannian geometry.

From the feedback I got, it seems that the course turned out nice -- even thought there will be a number of changes needed to improve it next year -- so I decided to remove the unfinished parts from the lecture notes and publish them [here](https://github.com/mseri/AoM/releases/download/0.10/aom.pdf "Lecture Notes PDF") for wider availability under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

You can follow its updates by monitoring the corresponding [Releases](https://github.com/mseri/AoM/releases "Versioned notes") page.
Once I believe that they are self-consistent and polished enough, I surely plan to rewrite and simplify the whole orientation chapter and add more on metrics and connections, I will publish it on the AMS open math notes like I did with the notes from [Hamiltonian Mechanics](content/post/45-AMS-open-math-notes.md "Hamiltonian Mechanics on the AMS open math notes").

As usual PR, feedback and corrections are always welcome.
Please make sure to acknowledge your contribution in the introduction if you contribute.
