Recently, I have had the pleasure and honour to give a "micro" course on spectral sub-Riemannian geometry for the [Dutch Differential Topology and Geometry seminar](https://www.few.vu.nl/~trt800/ddtg.html).
Given the current global circumstances, the course was given via Zoom and the organizers and participants have been kind enough to have it recorded and published online.

You can access the recordings of the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqM9_PzO5-M) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR0jUMCHsc) lecture on the [YouTube Channel of the DDT&G](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0o3PUqaC_ZhPNuM846kgg).
The slides [are also available](https://www.few.vu.nl/~trt800/ddtg/serinotes.pdf) (beware, they are 99Mb of handwritten pdf!).

Keep an eye on the seminar page, there are and will be more great seminars appearing soon.
