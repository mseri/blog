Since September I am a member of the [Young Academy Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/news/2021/03/the-young-academy-groningen-welcomes-seven-new-members).
One of the nice perks of being part of such incredible group of people (yes, I still wonder how I got there :P) was the opportunity to take a short course on dealing with the media and to record my "research minutes", a short, 2 minutes long, video to popularize my work.

The video is not yet on youtube, but is already available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YAGroningen/status/1441035218014687239) since some time.
I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did enjoy recording it, which was tiresome but really fun!
