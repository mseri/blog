This is a follow up from [the previous post]({{< relref "47-on-doing-a-phd.md" >}} "On doing a PhD").
I have stumbled upon a wonderful recent video by Steven Strogatz on Twitter which I believe could be extremely helpful for current and prospective PhD students in STEM, and for their advisors!

I think it is worth every minute of it:

Consider also listening to Strogatz' [The Joy of x](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-x/) podcast, it gives a beautiful, humane and informative snapshot into what research and researchers are like.
