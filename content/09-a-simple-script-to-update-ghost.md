You can update your ghost engine in many different ways, two for all by hand or by using git. 

I am personally using a very basic bash script. If you need a semiauthomatic way to run the update, you can just [copy/download it from gist](https://gist.github.com/mseri/7059958) and adapt to your needs.

I think it is simple enough to require no explanation.
