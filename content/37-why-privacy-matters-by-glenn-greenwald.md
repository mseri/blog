I am so sorry that I needed so much time before watching this wonderfully inspiring TED video.

I really admire Snowden, Greenwald and all the people that are fighting to denounce the dangerous path that we are following. 

It's time to take action, even the smallest one coubl make a difference. Maybe we don't see the threat now, but we cannot now what will happen in the future.
